I have teaching experience in the following courses at the National University of Singapore:
* IE2150E Human Factors Engineering, Spring 2018 & Spring 2019

* MT5012 Marketing of High-technology Products and Innovations, Fall 2020


I am passionate about leveraging AI tools to enhance the learning experience, and I actively incorporate these innovations into my teaching methods. One such example is the GPT tool I developed, which you can explore [here](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-28pRRZME3-your-analytics-buddy). It offers theoretical knowledge, coding guidance, and even research insights in data analytics and optimization, with a special focus on robust analytics. I regularly update it with my latest research and insights to ensure it remains a valuable and current resource, providing students with a dynamic and interactive learning environment.
