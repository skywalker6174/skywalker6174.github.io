I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto, Rotman School of Management. Before joining Rotman, I was a Research Fellow at the Institute of Operations Research & Analytics, National University of Singapore, where I completed my Ph.D. My academic journey began with a BSc in Statistics from the Department of Mathematics, Nanjing University.
