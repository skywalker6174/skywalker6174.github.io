I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. Prior to this, I served as a Research Fellow at the National University of Singapore, where I also completed my Ph.D. in Operations Research. My research is dedicated to two fields: (1) data-driven management of supply chain and logistics, encompassing both foundational and emerging business models such as the last-mile problem; and (2) analytics for social good, which targets essential issues like system robustness, social well-being, and sustainability.
